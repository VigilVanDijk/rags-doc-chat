The album was self-produced by the band and recorded at their own studio, Studio des Milans in France. This independence allowed complete creative control and unlimited time to experiment. The band members handled all aspects of production, engineering, and mixing.

The production philosophy emphasized organic sound and instrumental clarity. Rather than heavily processing or over-producing, the approach captured the band's live energy and natural dynamics. This gave the album a timeless quality that hasn't aged despite changing production trends.

The recording process allowed extensive experimentation with sounds, samples, and arrangements. The band incorporated environmental recordings, unusual mic placements, and unconventional techniques to achieve their desired sonic textures.
