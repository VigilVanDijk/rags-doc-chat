Guitar Work:
Joe Duplantier and Christian Andreu create a unified guitar sound characterized by precise palm-muting, harmonic picking, and tight synchronization. The guitar tone is thick and powerful without excessive gain or processing. Lead work emphasizes melody and serves the song rather than displaying pure technical virtuosity. Harmonized sections add depth and emotional weight.

Drum Performance:
Mario Duplantier's drumming combines technical metal precision with organic feel and creative phrasing. His work features complex polyrhythms, creative use of cymbals, powerful double bass work, and dynamic sensitivity. The drumming drives songs while leaving space for other instruments.

Bass Guitar:
Jean-Michel Labadie's bass work is unusually prominent in the mix and features melodic, active playing. The bass doesn't simply follow guitars but creates countermelodies and fills harmonic space. The tone is clear and punchy, maintaining definition even in the heaviest sections.

Vocal Approach:
Joe Duplantier's vocals range from death metal growls to hardcore-influenced shouts to occasional clean singing. The variety adds emotional texture and prevents monotony. Vocal patterns often emphasize rhythm and percussiveness, functioning almost as another instrument.
