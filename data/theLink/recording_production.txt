The album was recorded at Gabriel Editions Studio in France with the band heavily involved in production decisions. This allowed creative control and time to experiment with sounds and arrangements.

The production approach emphasized organic sound and instrumental clarity. Stephan Kraemer's mixing brought out the best in the performances while maintaining the band's raw power.

The recording process allowed the band to refine arrangements and explore atmospheric elements more fully than on their debut. The improved studio and increased experience resulted in a more polished but still powerful sound.
