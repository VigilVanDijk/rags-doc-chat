The Link sold modestly but steadily within metal communities, particularly in France and wider Europe. It built on the foundation established by Terra Incognita and expanded the band's audience.

The album enabled Gojira to tour more extensively and gain exposure to new audiences. It established them as a rising force in technical death metal.

While not achieving mainstream success, The Link gained respect within metal circles and positioned the band for the breakthrough that would come with From Mars to Sirius.
