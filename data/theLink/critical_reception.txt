The Link received positive reviews from metal critics who recognized it as a significant step forward for Gojira. Reviewers praised the improved production, increased songwriting sophistication, and the band's developing unique identity within technical death metal.

The album established Gojira as a band to watch within extreme metal circles, particularly in Europe. It demonstrated that the band was evolving beyond their influences and developing a distinctive voice.

In retrospect, The Link is viewed as an important transitional album that pointed toward the greatness of From Mars to Sirius while being a strong work in its own right. It showed a band confident enough to explore atmosphere and melody without sacrificing extremity.
