The Link is Gojira's second studio album and represents a significant evolution in their sound and conceptual approach. Following their debut Terra Incognita (2001), The Link sees the band refining their technical death metal approach while beginning to explore the progressive, atmospheric, and environmental themes that would define their later work.

The album is considered a transitional work that bridges Gojira's raw early material with the more sophisticated approach of From Mars to Sirius. It showcases increased songwriting maturity, improved production, and more ambitious conceptual content while retaining the aggression and technical prowess of their debut.

The central concept explores interconnection — between humans and nature, individuals, consciousness, and time. The "link" refers to these various connections and humanity's place within larger systems.
