Guitar Work:
Joe Duplantier and Christian Andreu display tight synchronization and precise execution. The guitar tone is thick and powerful with excellent clarity. Riff construction shows increasing sophistication, with memorable patterns that serve songs rather than just displaying technique. Harmonic work adds depth and emotion. Lead guitar work emphasizes melody and musicality over pure speed.

Drum Performance:
Mario Duplantier's drumming on The Link shows significant evolution from the debut. The performance features complex polyrhythms, creative cymbal work, powerful double bass passages, and excellent dynamic control. The drumming is technically impressive while serving the songs' needs. Fills and transitions are inventive without being excessive.

Bass Guitar:
Jean-Michel Labadie's bass work is prominent and melodically active. Rather than simply following guitars, the bass creates countermelodies and fills harmonic space. The tone is clear and punchy, maintaining definition even in the heaviest sections. The bass work contributes significantly to the band's powerful low-end presence.

Vocal Approach:
Joe Duplantier's vocals are primarily death metal growls with excellent clarity and power. Occasional clean vocal passages add variety and emotional texture. Vocal patterns emphasize rhythm and work with the music's polyrhythmic nature. The delivery has conviction and intensity throughout.
