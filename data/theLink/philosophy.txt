The lyrics on The Link show increasing sophistication and depth compared to Terra Incognita. Joe Duplantier's writing explores complex themes with genuine thoughtfulness rather than relying on genre cliches.

The album's philosophical approach draws from various sources including indigenous spirituality, environmental science, psychology, and Eastern philosophy. This eclecticism would become characteristic of Gojira's intellectual approach.

The lyrics avoid preaching while clearly expressing values and concerns. The writing invites contemplation rather than demanding agreement.

The Link engages with questions about consciousness and interconnection, humanity's relationship with the environment, and the possibility of personal transformation. It invites listeners to consider their own relationship to these themes.
