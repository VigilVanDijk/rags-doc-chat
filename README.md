# Gojira Album Knowledge Engine

This application is a document chat system that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation to answer questions about all of Gojira's discography. The system employs ChromaDB as a vector database with persistent storage, using HuggingFace all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings for semantic similarity search across document sections including tracklists, technical analysis, musical characteristics, lyrical themes, recording production, live history, commercial performance, and cultural impact. The retrieval process uses metadata filtering to precisely target specific albums and sections, while the generation layer leverages Groq's hosted LLM service using the llama-3.1-70b-versatile model for context aware response synthesis. The backend is built with FastAPI providing RESTful endpoints with CORS support, and LangChain orchestrates the RAG pipeline including document retrieval, context assembly, and prompt engineering. The frontend uses React with Material UI components and Axios for API communication. The core innovation is an intelligent query routing system that uses LLM based classification with confidence scoring to automatically determine query type as single, compare, or multi section queries, identify relevant document sections from a predefined taxonomy, and select target albums from the entire discography. When LLM confidence falls below a threshold of 0.7, the system falls back to keyword based routing using predefined section mappings. The retrieval strategy adapts based on routing results, using ChromaDB metadata filters for single queries, parallel document retrieval for comparison queries, and aggregated context assembly for multi section queries. Users can ask questions ranging from track counts to technical musical analysis, and the system intelligently routes queries to the appropriate sections and albums before performing semantic search, assembling context with specialized prompt templates, and generating accurate responses through the LLM.
